This line defines an anonymous `enum` with three named constants: `IDLE`, `WALK`, and `JUMP`. In this `enum`, each constant is assigned an integer value starting from 0, incrementing by 1 for each subsequent constant, unless explicitly specified otherwise.

Hereâ€™s what this enum represents:

- `IDLE` will have the value `0`.
- `WALK` will have the value `1`.
- `JUMP` will have the value `2`.

Using an anonymous `enum` like this is a common way to define named constants that represent different states or actions in a program. This can make the code more readable and maintainable compared to using raw integers.
